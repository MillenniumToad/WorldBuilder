Small scout ship for a large mining company is planning to scout a planet that is not supposed to be too technologically advance, the planet has an energy signature that has never been seen before. Upon nearing the planet the ship is hit with an EMP“Perfect” society with no violence, crime, or suffering. Seems unnatural, no one questions anything and all are equal. The crew from the ship manage to survive their crash landing with all, but sustaining only minor injuries.
